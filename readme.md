The cloudtooling lecture requires me to upload a personal project on GitHub. For this assignment i chose an old project from 2016 in which i my first attempt of the Euler challenge can be found. At the time I just learned some basic programming skills in Java. This means that the code is prone to errors and as far as i can remember, no conventions were taken into account. The reason i chose this project over one i am more proud of, are the assigmnents about test coverage and source code analysis. Mistakes are one of the best sources of self improvement and this project has a high probabillity that mistakes were made due to my unexperienced programming skills at the time.
